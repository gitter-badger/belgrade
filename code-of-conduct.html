      <h2>Need Help?</h2>

      <p>In case you need help or you want to report any activity that violates this code of conduct you can use:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Our twitter: <a href="https://www.twitter.com/jsbelgrade">@jsbelgrade</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          Or send an email to organizers: <a href="mailto:jsbelgradeorg@gmail.com">jsbelgradeorg@gmail.com</a>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Quick Version</h2>

      <p>Node School Belgrade is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. In short, if you are harassing someone or if someone interprets your actions as being harassment, you will definitely be asked to stop and possibly asked to leave (without refund where applicable) at the discretion of the event organizers.</p>

      <h2>The Less Quick Version</h2>

      <p>Node School Belgrade is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. Harassment of any kind will not be tolerated.</p>

      <p>"Harassment" includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>

      <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>

      <p>Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualized images, activities, language, or other material. Sponsor staff (including volunteers) should not wear overtly sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes or otherwise create a sexualized environment.</p>

      <p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion (with no refund where applicable).</p>

      <p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact an event volunteer or organizer immediately.</p>

      <p>If you can't easily locate an event volunteer or organizer or if you are uncomfortable doing so, you can contact the lead organizers, directly and discretely using any of the methods above "Need help?" section.</p>

      <p>Event volunteers and organizers will be happy to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event.</p>

      <p>We expect participants to follow these rules at all JS Belgrade and Node School Belgrade events, including after-event socializing.</p>
